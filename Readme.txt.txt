# PulseCheck – Lightweight ML-Based Classification of Heart Sounds Using PCG Signals

# Project Overview
**PulseCheck** is a lightweight Machine Learning–based system designed for the **classification of heart sounds (Phonocardiogram – PCG signals)** into categories such as **Normal** and **Abnormal**.  
It addresses the challenges of subjective diagnosis using a traditional stethoscope by providing an accessible, data-driven screening tool suitable for use in **rural healthcare**, **telemedicine**, and **digital stethoscope** applications.



# Abstract
Cardiovascular diseases are one of the major causes of death worldwide, which highlights the need for accessible and affordable screening techniques. Traditional methods using a stethoscope are subjective and require clinical expertise, making early detection a challenge in rural areas.

This project, **PulseCheck – Lightweight ML-Based Classification of Heart Sounds Using PCG Signals**, provides a machine learning system for classifying heart sounds as **Normal** or **Abnormal**. The system uses publicly available PCG signal datasets that undergo preprocessing steps such as resampling, noise reduction, and normalization to ensure consistent, high-quality data.

Features are extracted from these signals and processed through a lightweight ML pipeline that uses **SMOTE** for class balancing and **XGBoost** for classification. Experimental evaluation shows that PulseCheck achieves high accuracy, making it efficient and suitable for integration into mobile and clinical applications. The system can act as a valuable screening tool to aid early diagnosis and prevention of cardiac diseases.
